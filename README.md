# bukkure-fractalz
Creating fractals in Minecraft using Bukkure.

Using the [Bukkure plugin](https://github.com/SevereOverfl0w/bukkure) to create Minecraft plugins in Clojure.

Currently the only way to generate these triangles is to connect a repl to a Spigot server running Bukkure and run the following function :

```
(make-triangle 100 "<The name of your player>")
```
